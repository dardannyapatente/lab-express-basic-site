    <h1>A bit about his Work</h1>
    <h3>Who is Bill Gates</h3>
    <p>
      Entrepreneur and businessman Bill Gates and his business partner Paul
      Allen founded and built the world's largest software business, Microsoft,
      through technological innovation, keen business strategy and aggressive
      business tactics. In the process, Gates became one of the richest men in
      the world. In February 2014, Gates announced that he was stepping down as
      Microsoft's chairman to focus on charitable work at his foundation, the
      Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
    </p>

    <h3>Bill Gates and Founding Microsoft</h3>
    <p>
      In 1975, Gates and Allen formed Micro-Soft, a blend of "micro-computer"
      and "software" (they dropped the hyphen within a year). The company's
      first product was BASIC software that ran on the Altair computer. At
      first, all was not smooth sailing. Although Microsoft’s BASIC software
      program for the Altair computer netted the company a fee and royalties, it
      wasn't meeting their overhead. According to Gates' later account, only
      about 10 percent of the people using BASIC in the Altair computer had
      actually paid for it. Microsoft's BASIC software was popular with computer
      hobbyists, who obtained pre-market copies and were reproducing and
      distributing them for free. At this time, many personal computer
      enthusiasts were not in it for the money. They felt the ease of
      reproduction and distribution allowed them to share software with friends
      and fellow computer enthusiasts. Gates thought differently. He saw the
      free distribution of software as stealing, especially when it involved
      software that was created to be sold.
    </p>

    <h3>Microsoft’s Software for IBM PCs</h3>
    <p>
      As the computer industry grew, with companies like Apple, Intel and IBM
      developing hardware and components, Gates was continuously on the road
      touting the merits of Microsoft software applications. He often took his
      mother with him. Mary was highly respected and well connected with her
      membership on several corporate boards, including IBM's. It was through
      Mary that Gates met the CEO of IBM.
    </p>

    <h3>Bill Gates’s Rivalry with Steve Jobs</h3>
    <p>
      Though their rivalry is legend, Microsoft and Apple shared many of their
      early innovations. In 1981, Apple, at the time led by Steve Jobs, invited
      Microsoft to help develop software for Macintosh computers. Some
      developers were involved in both Microsoft development and the development
      of Microsoft applications for Macintosh. The collaboration could be seen
      in some shared names between the Microsoft and Macintosh systems. It was
      through this knowledge sharing that Microsoft developed Windows, a system
      that used a mouse to drive a graphic interface, displaying text and images
      on the screen. This differed greatly from the text-and-keyboard driven
      MS-DOS system where all text formatting showed on the screen as code and
      not what actually would be printed.
    </p>

    <h3>Leaving Microsoft</h3>
    <p>
      In 2000, Gates stepped down from the day-to-day operations of Microsoft,
      turning over the job of CEO to college friend Steve Ballmer, who had been
      with Microsoft since 1980. Gates positioned himself as chief software
      architect so he could concentrate on what was for him the more passionate
      side of the business, though he remained chairman of the board. In 2006,
      Gates announced he was transitioning himself from full-time work at
      Microsoft to devote more quality time to the foundation. His last full day
      at Microsoft was June 27, 2008. In February 2014, Gates stepped down as
      chairman of Microsoft in order to move into a new position as technology
      adviser. Longtime Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer was replaced by 46-year-old
      Satya Nadella.
    </p>

    <h3>The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</h3>
    <p>
      In 1994, Bill and Melinda established the William H. Gates Foundation,
      which was dedicated to supporting education, world health and investment
      in low-income communities around the world. The organization also tackles
      domestic issues, such as helping students in the United States become
      college-ready. With Melinda's influence, Bill had taken an interest in
      becoming a civic leader in the footsteps of his mother, studying the
      philanthropic work of American industrial titans Andrew Carnegie and John
      D. Rockefeller. He realized that he had an obligation to give more of his
      wealth to charity. In 2000, the couple combined several family foundations
      and made a $28 billion contribution to form the Bill & Melinda Gates
      Foundation. Over the next few years, Bill’s involvement with the Bill &
      Melinda Gates Foundation occupied much of his time and even more of his
      interest.
    </p>

    <h3>Awards</h3>
    <p>
      Gates has received numerous awards for philanthropic work. Time magazine
      named Gates one of the most influential people of the 20th century. The
      magazine also named Gates and his wife Melinda, along with rock band U2's
      lead singer, Bono, as the 2005 Persons of the Year. Gates holds several
      honorary doctorates from universities throughout the world. He was
      knighted as an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British
      Empire bestowed by Queen Elizabeth II in 2005. In 2006, Gates and his wife
      were awarded the Order of the Aztec Eagle by the Mexican government for
      their philanthropic work throughout the world in the areas of health and
      education. In 2016, the couple were again recognized for their
      philanthropic work when they were named recipients of the Presidential
      Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama.
