    <h1>A bit about Bill Gates</h1>
    <p>
      Bill Gates is a technologist, business leader, and philanthropist. He grew
      up in Seattle, Washington, with an amazing and supportive family who
      encouraged his interest in computers at an early age. He dropped out of
      college to start Microsoft with his childhood friend Paul Allen. He
      married Melinda French in 1994 and they have three children. Today, Bill
      and Melinda Gates co-chair the charitable foundation bearing their names
      and are working together to give their wealth back to society. Bill grew
      up in Seattle with his two sisters. His dad, William H. Gates II, is a
      Seattle attorney and one of the co-chairs of the Bill & Melinda Gates
      Foundation. His late mother, Mary Gates, was a schoolteacher, University
      of Washington regent, and chairwoman of United Way International.
    </p>

    <h3>Early Life</h3>
    <p>
      Gates was born William Henry Gates III on October 28, 1955, in Seattle,
      Washington. Gates grew up in an upper-middle-class family with his older
      sister, Kristianne, and younger sister, Libby. Their father, William H.
      Gates Sr., was a promising, if somewhat shy, law student when he met his
      future wife, Mary Maxwell. She was an athletic, outgoing student at the
      University of Washington, actively involved in student affairs and
      leadership. The Gates family atmosphere was warm and close, and all three
      children were encouraged to be competitive and strive for excellence.
      Gates showed early signs of competitiveness when he coordinated family
      athletic games at their summer house on Puget Sound. He also relished in
      playing board games (Risk was his favorite) and excelled at Monopoly.
      <br />
      Gates had a very close relationship with his mother, Mary, who after a
      brief career as a teacher devoted her time to helping raise the children
      and working on civic affairs and with charities. She also served on
      several corporate boards, including those of the First Interstate Bank in
      Seattle (founded by her grandfather), the United Way and International
      Business Machines (IBM). She would often take Gates along when she
      volunteered in schools and at community organizations.

    <h3>Bill Gatesâ€™s Wife and Children</h3>
    In 1987, a 23-year-old Microsoft product manager named Melinda French caught
    the eye of Gates, then 32. The very bright and organized Melinda was a
    perfect match for Gates. In time, their relationship grew as they discovered
    an intimate and intellectual connection. On January 1, 1994, Melinda and
    Gates were married in Hawaii. Following the devastating death of his mother
    to breast cancer just a few months after their wedding, they took some time
    off in 1995 to travel and get a new perspective on life and the world. In
    1996, their first daughter, Jennifer, was born. Their son, Rory, was born in
    1999, and a second daughter, Phoebe, arrived in 2002.

    <h3>Bill Gates's Personal Wealth</h3>
    <p>
      In March 1986, Gates took Microsoft public with an initial public offering
      (IPO) of $21 per share, making him an instant millionaire at age 31. Gates
      held 45 percent of the company's 24.7 million shares, making his stake at
      that time $234 million of Microsoft's $520 million. Over time, the
      company's stock increased in value and split numerous times. In 1987,
      Gates became a billionaire when the stock hit $90.75 a share. Since then,
      Gates has been at the top, or at least near the top, of Forbes' annual
      list of the top 400 wealthiest people in America. In 1999, with stock
      prices at an all-time high and the stock splitting eight-fold since its
      IPO, Gates' wealth briefly topped $101 billion.
