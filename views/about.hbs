 <h3>Early Life</h3>
 <p>
   Gates was born William Henry Gates III on October 28, 1955, in Seattle,
   Washington. Gates grew up in an upper-middle-class family with his older
   sister, Kristianne, and younger sister, Libby. Their father, William H.
   Gates Sr., was a promising, if somewhat shy, law student when he met his
   future wife, Mary Maxwell. She was an athletic, outgoing student at the
   University of Washington, actively involved in student affairs and
   leadership. The Gates family atmosphere was warm and close, and all three
   children were encouraged to be competitive and strive for excellence.
   Gates showed early signs of competitiveness when he coordinated family
   athletic games at their summer house on Puget Sound. He also relished in
   playing board games (Risk was his favorite) and excelled at Monopoly.
   <br />
   Gates had a very close relationship with his mother, Mary, who after a
   brief career as a teacher devoted her time to helping raise the children
   and working on civic affairs and with charities. She also served on
   several corporate boards, including those of the First Interstate Bank in
   Seattle (founded by her grandfather), the United Way and International
   Business Machines (IBM). She would often take Gates along when she
   volunteered in schools and at community organizations.

 <h3>Bill Gatesâ€™s Wife and Children</h3>
 <p>In 1987, a 23-year-old Microsoft product manager named Melinda French caught
 the eye of Gates, then 32. The very bright and organized Melinda was a
 perfect match for Gates. In time, their relationship grew as they discovered
 an intimate and intellectual connection. On January 1, 1994, Melinda and
 Gates were married in Hawaii. Following the devastating death of his mother
 to breast cancer just a few months after their wedding, they took some time
 off in 1995 to travel and get a new perspective on life and the world. In
 1996, their first daughter, Jennifer, was born. Their son, Rory, was born in
 1999, and a second daughter, Phoebe, arrived in 2002.

 <h3>Bill Gates's Personal Wealth</h3>
 <p>
   In March 1986, Gates took Microsoft public with an initial public offering
   (IPO) of $21 per share, making him an instant millionaire at age 31. Gates
   held 45 percent of the company's 24.7 million shares, making his stake at
   that time $234 million of Microsoft's $520 million. Over time, the
   company's stock increased in value and split numerous times. In 1987,
   Gates became a billionaire when the stock hit $90.75 a share. Since then,
   Gates has been at the top, or at least near the top, of Forbes' annual
   list of the top 400 wealthiest people in America. In 1999, with stock
   prices at an all-time high and the stock splitting eight-fold since its
   IPO, Gates' wealth briefly topped $101 billion.
